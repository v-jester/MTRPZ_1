### Application Description

In this lab work, I developed an application that identifies certain markdown syntax in text and replaces it with HTML tags. The application can detect bold, italic, monospaced texts, identify paragraphs, and preformatted parts of the text, replacing them with the appropriate tags.

### Instructions to Build the Project

To use this application, you need to have Node.js version 20 or higher installed. First, you need to clone this repository using the command:

```

git clone https://github.com/v-jester/MTRPZ_1.git
```

### Instructions to Use the Project

To run the parser, you need to:

1. Write the following command in the terminal:
```
node index.js <path to your md file>
```
2. Execute the command.

If you need to save the converted markdown syntax to an HTML file, you need to specify the --out flag, as shown in the example below:
```
node index.js <path to your md file> --out <path to the html file>
```
