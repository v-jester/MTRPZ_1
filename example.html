<p><b>Lay</b> me down to rest

On the hilltop <b>high</b>

In the <i>fields</i> so <b>vast</b>

Under <i>skies</i> wide and blue,

Where the <b>valleys</b>, and the peaks

Can be seen, can be felt,

As the wind whispers softly.

---

When the rivers carry

To the <i>endless</i> ocean

The <b>tears of sorrow</b>... then

Shall I leave the <b>plains</b> and valleys â€”

Leave all behind, and <i>soar*</i>

To the <b>heavens</b> above

To find peace... but until then

I wander in the dark.

<tt>Lay</tt> me down, but then rise,

Break the shackles

And with <b>courageous hearts</b>

Forge the path to freedom.

---

And in the big family,

In the family free and new,

<b>Remember me always</b>

With a gentle, kind word.</p>
